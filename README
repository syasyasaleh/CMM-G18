This file explains how our code files work, what they compute, and how they integrate together.

# File Structure
- Main Code - Stability.py: This main code will import and take values from the other 4 mini modules listed below.
                            This code runs the simulation loops, finds teh roots, and solves the ODE, plotting all final results regarding stability.
    - Hydrodynamics.py:
    - MMI.py:
    - Tower_mmi_CM.py:
    - Stability.py: 

- Power:

# How to run the code
You will only need to run two files: Main - Code.py and Power.py. 
1. Ensure that all the files listed above in File Structure are downloaded inside the same dictionary as they relate to each other.
   You will also need the following libraries installed: 'numpy', 'scipy', 'matplotlib'.

2. Open 'Main Code - Stability.py' and run the file.
   


# Implementation of Numerical Methods
- Root Finding

- ODE Solver

- Regression / Interpolation
